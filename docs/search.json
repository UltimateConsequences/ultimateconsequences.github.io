He is an Associate Professor of Anthropology and of Law at Vanderbilt University.\nFrom 2008 to 2013, he conducted ethnographic fieldwork and oral history interviews on social movements, race and space, protest tactics, and political change in Cochabamba, Sucre, and La Paz, resulting in a monograph, The Sovereign Street, and articles including \"Binding Leaders to the Community\" (Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology, 2018), \"Race and the Right to Speak for the City: Political Violence in Bolivia's 2006–2009 Stalemate\" (UAS, 2019), \"Unarmed Militancy\" (American Anthropologist, 2020). Using both anthropological and historical methods, The Sovereign Street explores how pivotal public events generate political legitimacy, contribute to major (sometimes revolutionary) transformations in the balance of power, and provide models for future political action. The ethnographic evidence collected about these events—of social life as experienced through the human body, the meanings attached to places, and social movement practices—explains how grassroots movements exert leverage upon the state through protest.\nUltimate Consequences is a quantitative and qualitative database, unique in its depth and completeness of coverage, of all conflict deaths in Bolivia since October 1982. It is supported by a research grant from the National Science Foundation and a Digital Humanities Incubation Grant from Vanderbilt University. Drawing on the database, Prof. Bjork-James wrote an expert witness report for the plaintiffs in Mamani et al. v.

    "text": "Mass grassroots politics in Bolivia has found highly contentious forms of action that were nonetheless distinct from a conventional military conflict. Its longer history, marked by indigenous uprisings, labor militancy, and frequent military rule has been described in terms of blood, fire, dynamite, and massacres. The social movement traditions that have resulted include proclamations of fearlessness (even protesting high schoolers shout, “Rifle, machine gun, we will not be silenced!”) and vows to carry struggles “until the final consequences.”\nThe database enumerates individual deaths in Bolivian political conflict since 1982, the end of military rule in the country. It is compiled by a research team based on multiple sources, including media reports, governmental, intergovernmental, and private human rights reports, and use of the research literature on political conflict. The dataset now includes nearly all of the deaths identified by a Permanent Assembly of Human Rights-Bolivia (APDHB) study of deaths from 1988 to 2003, and a study of the coca conflict from 1982 to 2005 (Navarro Miranda 2006; Llorenti 2009; Salazar Ortuño 2008). Unlike prior compilations by human rights organizations, however, this database includes a variety of qualitative variables designed to understand how and why the deaths occurred and what policies and patterns underpin them.\nWe designed the database to both catalog the lethal consequences of participation in social movements and political activism, and to assess responsibility, accountability, and impunity for violent deaths. All deaths are significant as signs of the price that has been paid to seek social change. Some deaths are also significant as elements of repression or violence for which someone might ultimately be held accountable. Rather than begin by asking, “Is this death someone’s fault?,” we are coding each death according to multiple factors that enable us to extract different subsets of the overall database for different purposes. We estimate there were between 580 to 620 deaths associated with Bolivian political conflict from October 1982 until December 2019. As of November 2022, the project had identified 621 to 639 of these deaths, including those of 600 named individuals. The database is maintained as a Google Docs spreadsheet, which can be queried by R scripts, and whose reports can be generated internally or exported for further manual coding. (Bold numbers in this paragraph are updated automatically using R scripts.)\nThrough this process, we have become familiar with reading multiple and conflicting reports, evaluating official denials (we have created a data column for such denials), collecting narrative accounts, coding what we can based on the information, and signaling remaining questions. One thing that we have learned through this process is that making informed judgements, rather than marking all disputed facts with some kind of asterisk, is absolutely foundational to being able to do comparative work. The scale of the dataset for this period is both large enough to identify significant patterns and small enough (unlike the situation in some other Latin American countries) to permit the construction of a database that includes detailed information about every death. Precisely because its coverage is nearly comprehensive, the database offers a systematic sample of cases for quantitative and/or qualitative analysis, untainted by selection bias. We can say with near certainty that the dataset includes all episodes of political conflict that caused three or more deaths since 1982.\nThe dataset offers a grounded view on such questions as: What practices and political choices result in some presidencies being far less violent than others? What is the relative importance of different forms of political violence, from repression of protest to guerrilla movements to fratricidal disputes among movements? Which movements have succeeded despite deadly repression? This database will serve as a new tool for social scientists, oral historians, and human rights advocates to use in answering these and other questions.\nThe situations described in the dataset principally involve the following:\n\nDeaths from repression or confrontations with security forces during protest\nDeaths from security force incursions into politically active communities that are related to their activism\nDeaths from inter-movement and intra-movement confrontations\nDeaths of all kinds related to guerrilla or paramilitary activity\nDeaths of all kinds related to the conflict over coca growing\nPolitical assassinations of all kinds, including public officials, political activists, and journalists\nDeaths of social movement participants while in police custody for their activism\nDeaths from the hardships of protests and acts of self-sacrifice such as hunger strikes, long-distance marches etc.\nActs of suicide as a form of protest\nAll deaths related to land conflicts that involve a collective/social movement organization on at least one side.\n\nFor each death, we record identifying information about the person who died, the individual or group who caused the death, the place and time of the death, the cause and circumstances of the death, whether the death appears to be deliberate or intended, the geographic location, the death’s connection to social movements and social movement campaigns, sources of information available about the death, types of investigation that have been performed, accountability processes, and relationship to the Bolivian state. Analytical variables used so far include: political assassination (a binary yes/no category); protest domain (aggregating all protest campaigns into a small number of topics such as “labor” and “municipal governance”); and denial (a binary yes/no category indicating whether the perpetrator denied responsibility for the death). In creating database entries, we create brief narrative descriptions of the events involved and/or quote such descriptions directly from sources of reporting.

    "text": "The database treats events as a fundamental unit. Event is a term with many definitions in the study of social movements and contentious politics from the pivotal historical moment to the action at a single time and place as recorded by news media, but the meaning used in the database is perhaps best captured by Charles Tilly’s term episodes: “bounded sequences of continuous interaction.” Bolivian mass mobilisation is organized in a routine sequence — collective organisation, mass mobilisation, escalation of tactics, negotiation, and concessions — and organizers work to propel the process forward repeatedly until the target, usually the government, gives in. Repressive force seeks to interrupt this process, usually by punishing movements in the mobilisation or escalation stages. For purposes of the database, we treat a relatively continuous series of actions as a single episode or event, unless and until it is interrupted by demobilisation.\n\n\n\nevent_title: Provides location and general theme of event\n\nEvent titles are brief, unique textual identifiers that should readily bring to mind the event (especially if the reader has heard of it before), and inform us as to what makes it distinctive. Therefore, unlike other elements of this codebook, there is rarely a single right answer. Also, we should be working to make these titles distinct, so when there are a lot of parallel events, we will need to be more specific.\nUse well-known names for events, if possible.\nThe event_title should state the scope of the conflict; name a locality or workplace if the conflict (or the notable deadly violence) is local. If the conflict is widespread, it should more often name the movement involved. It should name the social movement sector involved if relevant.\nIt should not name the form of violence unless it is unusual.\nUnique means that each event_title is distinct from all others in the dataset. Where needed add the year at the end of the event_title, then month or month pair. For example “Gas War 2003”, “CSUTCB mobilization April 2000.”\nThe variables, and this document are segmented into sections, each of which comprise several variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nmonth\nday: Date of the incident that caused death\n\nInteger values. Four-digit years, months from 1 to 12, days from 1 to 31.\n\n\n\n\nDayLater: later_year, later_month, later_day: Date of death, if the person died after the incident due to its consequences.\n\nOccasionally, we have an indeterminate date. Code these with the known information: October 2003 as 2003|10|[blank]. Use “or”, as in October 5 or 6 or 7, 2006 as 2006|10|5 or 6.\nHandling in R: Currently, our coding takes the first number in a textual date, retains the whole text as a note about the year, month, or day. Blank dates are automatically turned into a note reading “Unknown year” etc.\nIn the narrative: State the time if available.\nFuture options: Integrate with temporal sequence of the larger conflict (i.e., chronology of conflict could be an extended text field or link to other material)\n\n\n\n\nNote that we may choose to apply the term “victim” to deliberate deaths, according to whatever categories we choose, but the generic category in the dataset is “deceased.”\n\n\n\ndec_firstname All first and middle names\ndec_surnames: All surnames, including patronymic and matronymic surnames.\n\nDo not use ? to indicate uncertainty. Use parentheses () or slashes / instead.\nIf more than one name is found in the box:\n\nFirstName (other FirstName)- implies we think the victim’s name is the name outside of the parentheses, but a report may have indicated an alternate name\nFirstName / FirstName -implies that we have no idea which of the two is correct\nIf there are slashes in both first name and surname, they should be read as paired. A / B ; C / D, means the name is either A B or C D.\nFor last name use one of the following: PatronymicSurname MatronymicSurname\n\nPSurname (PSurname alt) MSurname\nPSurname MSurname (PSurname MSurname both alt)\nPSurname MSurname (MSurname alt)\nSingularSurname (SingularSurname alt)\n\n\nFor now, include names used in sources that are plausible misspellings among these alternative names (e.g., Miguel | Northfuster (Northdufter) Kerer). Likewise the multiple names for someone who has not been positively identified: Juan Carlos / Corado / Corado / NN | Ventura / Vilca / Veizaga / Fernández / Bejarano.\nWhen we have explicit reporting that a name was wrong, put the correct name in the name field and describe the misidentification in Complications: Gustavo | Cartagena Trujillo | Victim initially misidentified as “Edgar Vidal Rocha.”\n\n\n\n\nid_indiv — A unique identifier for each individual in the dataset that allows for cross referencing as the dataset evolves.\n\nWe want to be able to track changes in knowledge about individuals, for all fields including their names, so we assign each individual a unique identifier. This means that if their name changes, we change their inclusion status in the database (because, for example, we determine their death was accidental, or were misreported as dead), regroup them with different events, or determine that they are in fact a duplicate of another person, we can link that individual across different versions of the dataset.\nUnique IDs will also be assigned to individuals in the “Excluded from current analysis” tab once that tab is refactored to include all existing variables.\nIndividual ID (id_indiv) will take the form of the lowercase letter i followed by five numerical digits.\n\ni — is for individual (a conveniently bilingual first letter)\nFirst two digits assigned by year and allowing the research team to keep the unique ID’s roughly chronological without generating confusion among uninformed researchers.\n\n01 Indicates an unknown year\n02 corresponds to 1982;\n10 corresponds to 1990; 20 to 2000; 30 to 2010; 40 to 2020. So, deaths in 2019 would typically begin i39\n\nLast three digits are assigned sequentially in rough chronological order, beginnig with 001.\n\nWhere multiple events are occurring simultaneously, we will try to number sequentially within the events first.\n\nEvery line in the dataset gets an individual ID, including unconfirmed = TRUE, intentionality = Nonconflict accident, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\ndec_age: reported age\ndec_alt_age: alternatively reported ages\n\nExpressed as an integer. Unless under two years, then we may also have a fraction in twelths.\nData entry for months: Type: &lt;equals&gt; &lt;number of months&gt; &lt;division slash&gt; 12. So, six months: “=6/12.”\n\ndec_gender: gender\n\nOptions: M, F, text explanation\n\ndec_ethnicity: ethnicity\n\nOptions: Mestizo/Creole, Afro-Bolivian, or indigenous group name like Quechua, Aymara, Yuracaré.\n\nFor indigenous groups, use names as listed first in the following table. Use accents. Hyphenate if a mix of the above, and join alphabetically: Aymara-Guaraní.\nFor immigrant ethnicities use Adjective-Bolivian: Palestinian-Bolivian.\nForeign ethnicities of non-citizens: Adjective. Multiples: Adjective/Adjective.\n\nIf there are two or more ethnicities coinciding: hyphens (or slashes for foreigners)\nIf we are not sure which of two ethnicities we use “or”\nIf any uncertainty, leave blank until more information is found.\n\n\nImage of contemporary groups provided by Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndec_residence: Indicates place of residence, not origin\n\nProvide the most specific location as is know. For example, if community is known, provide community. If it is not known “Municipality” is fine; “Municipality, Department” where ambiguous. “Department” where that’s all we know.\nIf there’s a longer story (e.g., a Huanuni miner of El Alto origin), list their current long-term residence (Huanuni, Oruro) in this field and add to the notes.\n\ndec_nationality: nationality\n\nProper noun of the country in English, not an adjective: Bolivia, Peru, United States, etc. Reported dual nationals get slashes: France/Bolivia.\n\n\n\n\nTo Do: specifically we need to make sure cocaleros and campesinos are coded correctly and check to see if anyone needs to be coded as private security.\n\ndec_affiliation, dec_spec_affiliation: categorical and specific affiliation\n\ndec_affiliation is a broad sectoral group. It uses the same categories as for perp_affiliation\nUse one of the following\n\nCocalero\nCampesino (includes CSUTCB, CONAMAQ, CSCIB)\nLowland Indigenous (not Quechua, Uru, or Aymara, even if members of these groups are living in the lowlands)\nHighland Indigenous (only Layme, Qaqachaka, Jukumani, and related communities involved in the Oruro–Potosí boundary disputes and Guerra de los Ayllus)\nMiner\nFactory Worker\nTransport Worker — includes taxi and trufi drivers, bus drivers, cargo truck drivers, and railworkers.\nTeacher —The Magisterio and the Normalistas (“teachers” in training from this perspective)\nLandowner — a class designation to be used when relevant, e.g., for the San Julián blockade\nUrban Movement (not more specifically identiifed above)\nPartisan, a non-officeholding militant or agent of a political party\nStudent: Engaged in collective student protest (as a student). Protesting students in larger movements should be folded in to categories above. If not protesting but are a bystander can note student in specific affiliation category\nJournalist\nCivilian (implies non-protester)\nProtester (if not identifiable by one of the above categories)\nSecurity Force: Someone employed by the State, either as a police officer or within the military\nPrivate Security: Security personnel employed privately, not by the State (new and not yet recoded)\nGovernment Officeholder\nGovernment Employee (i.e., not in security forces or in an elected role)\nArmed Actor (member of organized armed groups, including generally politically left “guerrilla,” generally politically right “paramilitary” groups, and extra official perpetrators of violence “sicarios”)\nNarcotrafficker: Individual involved in drug trade\n\nWe want to be able to ascertain whether any person is security forces (Security Force, Private Security), someone else in an organized armed organization (Armed Actor), or state civilian official (Government Officeholder, Government Employee) or a [non-state] civilian. Analysis on this nt should be possible using this variable, grouping some categories together.\n\ndec_spec_affiliation: The name of the specific organization/party/branch of security etc. The more exact or specified affiliation emerging from the victim’s overarching affliation\ndec_title: title or occupation: Refers to their title within the organization they are affiliated with. Such as rank in military or congressional position.\n\nIf they are an officer within a union and the union is acting in the conflict, this is their title within the union: “Director of Conflicts,” “Vice President”. Otherwise, indicate their title at work: factory foreman. If they die as workers not engaged in collective action (e.g., victims of the fire in the El Alto municipal building), do not seek out a movement affiliation, use their job title as best you can describe it, or simply state “municipal employee.”\nIf they are a civilian or protester, use this field to state their occupation if known.\n\n\n\nVariables included in this category: cause_death, cause_medical, live_ammunition, victim_armed, weapon, denial, pol_assassination, state_perpetrator﻿\nNote: This is the first place where we may maintain a default set of exclusions from further analysis\n\n\n\ncause_death: brief, nominal description of what (usually external) act caused the death/death causing injury: The goal is to describe the external act that happened- what was enacted on the person. For example- if a person died in a fire the cause of death would be the building burning. The Medical cause of death would be burns.\n\nIf coinciding factors resulted in a death, a comma is used to symbolize plurality. Ex. (gunshot, impact)= (gunshot and impact).\nIf reports consistently note two different causes of death and the exact cause is not known a slash is used to denote OR. Ex. (gunshot/beating)= (gunshot or beating).\nBlank spaces indicate that cause of death is unknown.\nCauses of death include the following. This list is not exhaustive; other categories not listed below, but included in the database are self-explanatory.\n\nInduced health crisis: (induced via social circumstances including extra stress due to protest conditions or previous accident or injury sustained in a political event)\nIllness: An illness that occured during but not as a result of political events\nLack of necessary care: (lack of needed care due to difficulty reaching care and/or external forces preventing care. If the person was injured and then prevented from reaching necessary care, the injury is listed first in cause of death and more specific circumstances are detailed in the notes).\nGunshot: Fatal wound incurred from a gun (live ammunition)\nImpact: hit with an object thrown or projected at them during protest (rocks, stones, tear gas canister). Not from a gun or interpersonal beating.\nAssault: signifies an attack that can include both a beating and weapons such as knifes and machetes\nBeating: No weapons were used, violent interpersonal force\nVehicle: Incident involving a vehicle. Specifics of death are noted in parentheses, ie: hit by car (which implies that the individual was not in a car when struck; car crash (the individual was in a car when struck); dragged (individual was not in a car when dragging occurred).\nExplosion: Any explosion caused by a variety of weapons, (IED, gas station, grenade, dynamite, etc.)\nNon-conflict: Indicates that the death occurred outside of a conflict or political situation\n[Blank]: Left blank if precise cause of death is unknown\n\n\n\n\n\ncause_medical: brief, nominal description of the medical cause of the death\n\nA succinct medical description of why the person died; what hospitals report or what appears in an autopsy. Generally a noun phrase laden with jargon.\nGiven the technical language, it’s generally good to keep untranslated language here, unless we are really confident of the wording.\n\n\n\n‘munition’ assesses whether live ammunition and other dangerous explosives were used in the killing. The order below indicates both relative danger and a prioritization for coding. (That is, if someone was both shot with live ammunition and teargassed, we code “Live ammunition” (1) instead of “Tear gas” (3).)\nFormerly live_ammunition; Alluvial2.Rmd has code to deal with both cases.\n\nmunition: (note that explosive is a new category)\n\nDenotes if live ammunition was used and other categories of ammunition.\n\nLive ammunition: live ammunition / standard gunshot. “Bala,” “balazo,” “proyectil arma de fuego,” “raffaga” in sources all count as yes. So do descriptions involving named types of guns.\nExplosive: Indicates an explosive not fired as a projectile: grenades, dynamite, homemade explosive device (“explosivo casero,” “cazabobos”), bomb vest.\nLess lethal munition: non-“live ammunition” projectile. Non-lethal/less-lethal munitions (tear gas canister, rubber or wooden bullets). “Perdigón” (marble/shot), “balín” (rubber bullet/plastic bullet/shot) in description.\nTear gas: Tear gas (not the canister)\nOther violence: (was “N/A”) No munitions of any kind are involved but physical violence still took place. Ex. Torture, beating, vehicle, stabbing, arson. As such, this category still indicates some form of interpersonal interaction/violence.\nNone: No weapon at all was used. Death was the result of illness or fall, drowning, electrocution, etc.\n[Blank] — We don’t know what weapon was used.\nLikely [category name] as described for quasilogicals\nTwo potential possibilties are linked with or\n\n\n\n\n\nvictim_armed: Quasilogical on whether the decedent was armed\n\n\nYes only if carrying a gun. “Presumed Yes,” if member of a security force, but we lack specific information. No if non-lethal/less-lethal munitions.\nDisarmed — an additional value that indicates that the subject carried a lethal weapon, but was disarmed of it prior to being killed.\nWith Explosive — If the victim carried an explosive not fired as a projectile: grenades, dynamite, homemade explosive device (“explosivo casero,” “cazabobos”), bomb vest.\nPresumed Yes — We presume that state security force members are armed. (Though obviously we don’t ignore evidence to the contrary.)\nWe presume that when sources describe a group the victim was part of as armed, but do not specifically note that the victim was armed, the victim was armed.\nPresumed No — We presume uninvolved bystanders, children, and those engaged in explicitly non-confrontational protest (e.g., hunger strikers) are unarmed.\nLikely Yes, Likely No, Disputed, blank as described for quasilogicals\n\n\nweapon: What weapon was used? Nominal factor. Weapon listed when in need of clarification. If the death could have been caused by more than one option, a slash is used to indicate alternatives. Options, in priority order:\n\n\nBullet — Always the term for gunfire with live ammunition. We’re completely un-interested in descriptions of the firing weapons. No “rifles,” “pistols” etc.\nLess-lethal munition —If specific munition is not known “less lethal munition” is used. If specific munition is known it is listed.\nNon-lethal/less-lethal munitions options include: (rubber or wooden bullets). “Perdigón” (marble/shot), “balín” (rubber bullet/plastic bullet/shot) in description. Also includes bladed weapons such as knifes and machetes. But not tear gas or teargas canisters, which get their own categories.\n\n\nTear-gas canister — for effects of its physical impact\nTear gas (no hyphen) — for effects of inhalation\nExplosive- cazabobos, grenade etc.\nProjectile — things that are thrown, hurled, or slingshotted. Specific weapon listed in parentheses\n\n\nArson- Purposefully induced fire\nTorture- Denotes that torture is specifically noted in the reports of the death. No researcher judgment was made in the term.\nStrangulation- Some weapon was used to strangle the victim\nBeating — no weapons, but violent interpersonal force\nNon-conflict accident- Death was caused outside of a conflict incident\nFall- Denotes that the victim fell from some surface(often while fleeing conflict repression). From where the victim fell is indicated in ().\nVehicle: Some type of vehicle accident was involved. The type of incident is indicated in ().\nGas station explosion\nStones/rocks\nNone: No weapon was involved. Includes drowning, some falls etc.\nBlank: The specific weapon used is unknown\n\nPriority order means that if something matches two of the options listed here, we report the first one. So yes, a tear-gas canister is a projectile, but we don’t have to say both.\n\n\n\n\n\nperp_catgory: Type: Individual/Group/None: Was the killing done by one person, by a group acting together, or not the result of external action.\n\n\nIndividual includes solitary acts of violence. It also includes instances where a group is protesting/repressing, but only one person deploys lethal force. Also includes instances in which a conflict accident occurs (such as faulty manipulation of dynamite)\nGroup includes any time when a group is engaged in common violence towards the victim or the group the victim is a part of.\nSelf Intentionally deadly acts of self-sacrifice. Neither includes conflict accidents (such as faulty manipulation of dynamite), nor unforeseen losses in acts of self-risking protest\nNone should be used whenever there is no external act of violence: death on hunger strike, from exposure to cold, electrocution on an electric fence.\n\n\nperp_group is a specific organization.\n\nIf known, the specific branch of the military is listed. If not known, “State security” is listed. Where multiple organizations or security forces collaborate, list them all here.\n\nPresumed: Indicates that a conclusion that we draw about the variable based on other facts of the case, in a systematic way. For example, for victim_armed, presumed yes/no indicates that the victim falls into a category which would predispose them to having or not having a weapon even if such was not indicated. These rules should be written into the codebook, and should be relatively strong.\nLikely – Indicates that the researcher is making a judgment based on the source information provided. Explanations of these judgment calls should be written in parentheses (if brief), or into the narrative for the event.\nLeave blank if unclear or unknown If multiple groups involved use comma to denote AND. If unsure about potential groups involved use / to denote OR.\n\n\nperp_affiliation is a broad sectoral group. Same categories as for dec_affiliation. See above.\n\n\n\n\n\nintentionality indicates if the violence inflicted on the victim was an intended consequence.\n\nOptions: If weapon, arson, or assault involved…\n\nDirect: Deadly force was used deliberately, and they were struck. This includes cases where the weapon (e.g. a teargas canister or tear gas itself) is usually nonlethal. We can assess such cases by looking at the weapons involved. This also includes victims of beatings, assaults, deaths from physical confrontations (unless the victim is a bystander). This also includes instances of mistaken identification.\nBystander: A deliberate attack that killed someone outside of the conflict (e.g. Victor Hugo Daza in 2000)\nRe: journalists, mediators, etc.: Let’s flag these as “Direct on journalist/mediator/etc” and try to see if there’s something to figure out. From what I can tell, there are several instances of deliberately targeted journalists (Encinas, the Alta Loma journalist guide, Radio Municipal death, etc.). I’m not sure there is a clear instance of a bystander.\nConflict Accident: Any unintended death that occurs through no deliberate attempt to harm, but which was perpetrated by someone engaging in the conflict. e.g., weapons misfires, dynamite that explodes in the hand of a protester). Includes “Friendly fire”: Any unintended death that was caused through acts of violence, but which was perpetrated by someone engaging in the conflict and which strikes someone with whom they are acting together.\n\nRegardless of whether a weapon was involved… 5. Self-sacrifice: includes starvation in hunger strike, suicide (related to conflict incident), or intentionally self-inflicted death with a weapon . Explicitly excludes accidental self-inflicted death with a weapon (those are conflict accidents).\nWhen no weapon is involved… 6. Conflict Accident: Any unintended death that occurs through no deliberate attempt to harm, but which was perpetrated by someone engaging in the conflict. e.g., protesters pull down a wall, but kill someone in the process; electrocution in the process of scaling a secured facility) 7. Non-conflict Accident: Any unintended death that occurs through no deliberate attempt to harm, and outside the context of open physical confrontation: e.g., car crash into a protest march (which the driver was not targeting) 8. Non-conflict: Any other death whose causes can’t be traced to acts of conflict, but for which the word “accidental” is inappropriate. Includes situations where a medical situation leads to death, but is not traceable to the privations of conflict. And situations where interpersonal violence is not related to political conflict (e.g., armed robbery), and cases of non-conflict-driven suicides. 9. Incidental: Any indirect consequence of intended acts upon the participants. Deaths from the privations of nationwide marches, or due to the follow-on trauma of police raid. (or if someone had died in Chaparina when the police blockaded the marchers and denied access to food). Includes deaths to children of participants collateral to their acts. 10. Collateral: Any indirect consequence of intended acts upon non-participants. Deaths from lack of medical attention due to blockades, consequences of re-routed plane flights, etc.\n&gt;&gt; Possibility of unknown or disputed causality, as in the case of Campanas during the Water War. Weapon is “hanging”; Intentionality is disputed between direct/self-sacrifice.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this information to create a Geo-tag if possible: We’re not implementing this for now, but it’s desirable for later in the project. Please add further information not captured in these fields to Notes.\n\nplace: A named or described place\nlocation_precision: How specific is the geocoded address. Refers to columns to the right, not to place\n\naddress: Specific address, eg: 1 Main St.\n\npoi_small: A small nt of interest, eg: Jim's Pizza.\n\nintersection: Intersection of two roads, eg: 6th Avenue and Izabel Street\n\nblock: Block level address, eg: 100 Block of Main St.\n\npoi_large: A large nt of interest, eg: Central Mall.\n\nroad: Road name, eg: Glenwood Drive\n\ncommunity: Neighborhood or rural community\ntown: Specifically the town or urban area associated with municipality\nrural_zone: The rural portion of the place named\nmunicipalty, province, department: Only specified to these legal areas\n\nregion: A larger-than municipality region, like the Chapare or the La Paz Yungas.\n\naddress: Street Address / Intersection. A street, intersection, or street address\ncommunity Urban neighborhood or rural community\n\nNearly all urban places have neighborhood names. Many rural communities are smaller units than municipalities.\n\nmunicipality\nprovince\ndepartment\n\nWe use Spanish accents: Potosí, not Potosi. Never write “X Municipality,” just X is fine. Complete list of municipalities. Complete list of provinces, with a lovely table of municipalities and cantons (submunicipal sections). Wikipedia (usually English, sometimes German) and several other Google-able websites can locate obscure communities. Be forewarned that many new settlements (urban neighborhoods, recent agrarian settlements in Chapare and the east) are named after other ones, so do not Google a community name and “learn” from the search that it is located in another department across the country. If in doubt, check in about this.\nThe number of municipalities in Bolivia has risen from an initial twenty-four (in 1994) to 327 (in 2005), to 337 (in April 2010), to 339 (as of August 2010). Where municipal boundaries have changed, we use specific locality to specify the current, smaller municipality. But if no information is available on a smaller scale than the municipality name, we use the named municipality. If you look up a rural community in a post-2011 reference work to find the municipality, but the event is before 2011, make a note in “complications” saying so.\nProvincial and departmental boundaries (where set and undisputed) have been unchanged through this period.\n\n\n\n\nThese fields allow us to specify the reasons for confidence in identifying who was the perpetrator of violence, the kind of information they used, and whether responsibility has been denied.\n\nhighest_source\n\nThe strongest source naming the perpetrator as the database does.\n\ncertainty_level: Level of Certainty Re Perpetrator\n\nGenerally, Suspected &lt; Alleged &lt; Reported &lt; Audiovisual documentation &lt; Investigated &lt; Admitted &lt; Convicted. Indicate highest level and explain in “Strongest Source”\n\nSuspected — A source suspects (without saying definitively) that a person or party was responsible for the killing\nAlleged — A source (often non-neutral) alleges that a person or party was responsible for the killing. (Does not require a legal allegation.\nReported — A reputable, neutral source has stated that the person or party was responsible for the killing. This level encompasses most news reporting.\nAudiovisual documentation — There is direct video, photographic, or (less common) audio evidences that the person or party was responsible for the killing.\nInvestigated — A reputable source has investigated the incident and concluded that the person or party was responsible for the killing.\nAdmitted — The responsible party acknowledges responsibility. Includes recorded statements, confessions, and guilty pleas. While this is a higher level of certainty, investigations that conclude this kind of evidence is inaccurate (e.g., coerced or false) may override such statements.\nConvicted — A reputable judicial process, following a prior investigation, held the party responsible.\n\n\ndenial Did the perpetrator or affiliates deny responsibility?\n\n\nNo — Perpetrator (or their hierarchical superior) does not deny responsibility for the injury/death. Essentially only use this when there is an admission of responsibility.\nYes — Perpetrator (or their hierarchical superior) denies responsibility for the injury/death or claims it from alternate causes that what victim’s family/friends/fellow protesters claim. All details should be spelled out in the denied_by column in the formats: Official Title John Q. Denier: “Quote saying we didn’t do it” or Official Title John Q. Denier (brief summary of denial story).\nPartial — Denied some aspect of the story-use of specific weapon or culpability. No denial of events but denial of responsibility or an aspect of the narrative.\nLikely Yes, Likely No, Disputed, blank as described for quasilogicals\n\nIf we accept the denial as genuinely factual, we don’t include it here. In that case the falsely accused perpetrator doesn’t appear as the “perpetrator” at all.\nThere is no pressure to convert blanks into “No.” Only affirmative evidence of accepted responsibility gets a no. We should expect there will be many blanks here.\nNote on disputed vs denial: This research project takes responsibility for evaluating categorical variables. If we are indicating “disputed,” that means not only is the answer disputed, but also that we cannot resolve the dispute. On the other hand, we have a variable for “denial” in the database that will absorb explanations by interested parties that are judged implausible. There are many cases when officials (and occasionally other responsible parties) make claims that deny their responsibility and put it on the victims. Those will be recorded as full or partial denials in the denial variable, and explained in the denied_by variable. (For a detailed explanation of the thought process involved in this, see “Why I evaluated the government claims that protesters”shot one another” as a denial rather than throwing all the facts in question” here).\n\ndenied_by Attribute the denial to a person or institution.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral approach is to modify yes / no structure as described below. Unknown is blank.\n\n\n\ndisciplinary_acct Internal accountability process within a state institution\nSpecify accountability process: e.g., Internal investigation, suspended, fired. Keep this short but tell us the topline details. e.g., “All involved officers suspended”\nNo — Only when we have sources asserting no accountability.\n\n\n\n\n\njudicial_acct Judicial process, successful or unsuccessful, domestic or international\nSpecify forum and current outcome:: e.g., Criminal indictment, US Federal Court case filed.. Keep this short but tell us the topline details. Describe in detail in the notes.\nEventually, we want to have clarity about when these efforts were frustrated, but for now just clearly state things like acquitted.\nNo — Only when we have sources asserting no accountability.\n\n\n\n\n\nhr_report Human rights reporting and investigation\n\nRefers only to reporting that was specific to the incident, often with an investigative team focusing on the event.\n\nvictim_compensated Material compensation for the victim’s family\nYes — With topline details in parentheses\nNo — If evidence or our knowledge make clear that there was no material compensation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npres_admin Which presidency was active during the event\n\nA very straightforward mapping to time period. Do not consider the “president in exercise” when a president is out of the country. Should match list on the “By Presidency” tab.\n\nRené Barrientos\nLuis Adolfo Siles Salinas\nAlfredo Ovando Candía\nJuan José Torres\nHugo Banzer (1st)\nJuan Pereda\nDavid Padilla (Chairman of the Military Junta)\nWálter Guevara\nAlberto Natusch\nLydia Gueiler Tejada\nLuis García Meza Tejada (2nd)\nJunta of Commanders of the Armed Forces 1981\nCelso Torrelio\nGuido Vildoso\nHernán Siles Zuazo\nVíctor Paz Estenssoro\nJaime Paz Zamora\nGonzalo Sanchez de Lozada (1st)\nHugo Banzer (2nd)\nJorge Quiroga\nGonzalo Sanchez de Lozada (2nd)\nCarlos Diego Mesa Gisbert\nEduardo Rodriguez\nEvo Morales\nInterim military government\nJeanine Áñez\nLuis Arce\n\nThese names—imported from Wikipedia—have some inconsistencies in the Spanish naming conventions, as well as confusion about why we’ve numbered Banzer “2nd” (he served before the study period). While we’ve deferred to them so far, we should probably clean them up and make required changes to the code before our release.\n\n\n\nGenerally, there will be a nesting of event_title, protest_campaign, protest_domain.\n\nprotest_campaign: A unique identifier that indicates the specific topic over which conflict emerged. Campaign is determined through identifying overarching demands, complaints, or tension that sparked the conflict.\n\nThis field is left blank in cases where the victim died in custody, enough information is not known to detail a specific campaign, or in non-conflict related accidents such as the journalist suicide with explosive device.\n\nprotest_domain Broad arena of political struggle, combining multiple campaigns.\n\nExplanations given for domains as needed (if they are not self implied)\nCurrent list: - Coca: Conflicts involving disputes over right to grow coca - Gas wars - Rural Land: Conflicts over territorial borders/boundaries occurring in rural areas. For example, the Laymi-Qaqachaka confrontations. - Partisan Politics - Mining - Economic Policies - Labor - Peasant - Municipal governance: Disputes or conflicts over elected officials in the municipal government. - Urban land: Conflicts over territorial borders or land ownership in urban areas. For example, the Pampa San Miguel urban land conflict. - Drug Trade - Guerilla - Ethno-Ecological: Mobilizations over the protection of the environment and/or protection or authority over cultural connections to land and environmental resources. For example, the TIPNIS mobilizations. - Local Development - Disabled: Mobilizations surrounding the rights of those with disabilities - Paramilitary - Contraband - Education\n\n\n\n\npol_assassination: Quasilogical. We define “political assassinations” as targeted killings of persons in organizational leadership or political office. Includes cases where the killing is carried out amid a larger scenario but in a highly targeted fashion.\n\n\nYes\nNo\nLikely Yes – as described for quasilogicals\nPossibly Yes — Indicates that evidence (typically evidence that the murder was politically motivated) is limited, but the act could be assassination.\n\n\n\n\n\nstate_perpetrator: Were state security forces the perpetrator Quasilogical. Addresses the narrow question of whether state security forces carried out the killing.\n\n\nYes\nNo\nLikely Yes, Likely No – as described for quasilogicals\nDisputed – as described for quasilogicals, opposing narratives and we can’t decide\n\nReminder: Presumed categories refer to conclusions we draw for reasons listed here in the codebook\n\nPresumed Yes — When a short textual source uses the passive voice (“resultó muerto”) regarding the death of a non-state actor in a security forces vs. movement confrontation..\nPresumed No — Deaths of non-state actors described as due to nearly exclusively non-state weapons such as rocks or dynamite\nIndirect — When a State security force did not directly inflict harm through physical violence but actively contributed to the death through their actions (involvement in repression). For example, if a victim was fleeing state repression and fell or were trampled etc.\n\n\nstate_responsibility: Categorical characterization of state responsibility\n\nThis categorical characterization does not take qualifiers like “likely”, “presumed”, etc. They can be found in state_perpetrator and in intentionality.\n\n\n\nTally of state responsibility values on December 6, 2022\n\n\nIn analyzing the data, we’ve found it necessary to add more categories related to security forces in mutiny, so as to sort out state responsibility from non-state-coordinated action by security forces.\n\nState perpetrator: A state actor is responsible for the action that caused the victim’s death. Assertive programming should verify that this coincides with one of the “Yes” categories for state_perpetrator.\nState victim\nSeparate from state: Mobilization and conflict does not involve State actors or mobilizations against governmental policies\nState involved: Though a State actor did not commit the act responsible for the victim’s death, the State was involved in crafting the conditions in which the conflict emerged.\nPolitical Victim: The victim held an elected position in government\n\n\nstate_failure: Brief explanation of state failures that contributed to deaths. Variable consists of a textual explanation.\n\nUnnecessary when state responsibility takes the form of State perpetrator, but occasionally a valuable addition. For example, if some state oversight create a situation where state violence was more likely.\n\nUnpoliced situation — Indicates that deadly violence among non-state actors was predictable, but the State took no meaningful action.\nTry to summarize multiple failures as in ““Dept govt employees among perpetrators, armed state allies present, policing failures”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerp_pol_stalemate, Dec_pol_stalemate\n\nDuring the Catastrophic Stalemate 2006-2009\n\nPerpetrator Political Affiliation: Left Grassroots or Civic Movement or National Government\nVictim Political Affiliation: Left Grassroots or Civic Movement or National Government\n\nLet me explain these categories: during the three years of intense polarization between the election of the country’s first indigenous president in December 2005 and the declaration of a plurinational Bolivia under a new constitution in February 2009. This “catastrophic stalemate” was a deadlock between a broad coalition of the rural and urban indigenous peoples, movements of the poor and working class (collectively, the “left grassroots”) and the Morales’ Movement Toward Socialism (MAS-IPSP) party on one side, and a political opposition backed by right-wing “civic movements” calling for regional autonomy from that government. While the heart of the right’s resistance to the Morales government was the eastern departments (Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, and Tarija), major episodes occurred in the central cities of Cochabamba and Sucre. In Santa Cruz, Cochabamba, and Beni, (and possibly Pando and Tarija) there’s a departmental Civic Committee at the heart of the civic movement. However, in Potosí there is an a political active civic committee whose positioning is solidly with the left grassroots.\nDuring the 2019 Political Crisis\n\nPerpetrator Political Affiliation: Pro-MAS or Anti-MAS or Security Forces\nVictim Political Affiliation: Pro-MAS or Anti-MAS or Security Forces or Bystander or Other Protest (i.e., participating in a protest not part of the crisis)\n\n\n\n\nMeta-comment about cleaing up the following… While this is all important material for producing the borader archive, the R package simply skips over the narrative variables, so we don’t have to complete this to complete and release the R package.\n\n\n\ncomplications Text. Indicate anything that makes one of the variables difficult to code here. Say if we need to rethink our coding options to cover this case. Also report unresolved uncertainties.\n\nNote that we also have a text file called “Complex cases” that absorbs additional coding complications\n\n\n\n\nnotes Brief narratives. Sequences of quoted text.\n\nSince a database text field is an awkward place for extended text, these should eventually be saved into separate Markdown files which can have proper citations.\nQuotes ultimately belong there, in those files, not here.\nCurrently, there are cited narratives written on a one-per-event basis. These exist alongside these notes sections. Eventually, it probably makes the most sense to build a library and a file structure of such documents. This will involve untangling the writing and referencing here. Perhaps there will be both overall narratives and specific material attached to individuals.\n Going further, we may create a lookup table by individual to such event files, as well as to photos, testimonial accounts (or more likely, the metadata for these will have nters to individuals in the dataset), and other person-specific data. However, this will go along with the creation of unique identifiers for persons in the project, which is one more thing that may require a re-factoring of the dataset import process.\n\n\n\n\nrefs: References.\n\nA list of referenced materials. Separate with |\nAcceptable formats:\n\nCommonly reused sources in Author Date:Page format. For example, Miranda 2013:37.\nFull bibliographic entry, generated by Zotero, with the source stored in our shared library. Ideally in Chicago (full note) format. Use this format for newspaper articles photographed in archives.\nBare URLs for references. There are lots of these, but we want to store them all in Zotero and replace them with full references, as well as get “snapshots” of the material into the Zotero library. It would be incredibly nice to innovate a script or workflow that harvests these URLs, keeps track of where they appeared, checks for valid online data, adds bibliographic entries to Zotero, and ultimately replaces the bare URLs with proper citations.\n\n\n\n\n\nsee_also: Follow-ups and cross-references\n\nUse this column to refer to: - Bibliographic references (formatted as in refs) to sources that do not describe the death, but do describe memorial events, commemorations, statues, and other sequelae to the death.\n\nCross-references to other deaths: Indicate briefly and clearly the relationship to another death\nJoining several deaths to the same sub-event, for example among the many deaths of the Sep-Oct 2003 Gas War.\n\n\n\n\n\nnavarro_2006_number: Place in Navarro 2006’s numbered list\n\nThere is a mulitpage numbered list of deaths in Navarro Miranda, César. Crímenes de la democracia neoliberal y movimientos sociales: desde la masacre de Villa Tunari a El Alto. La Paz: Fondo Editorial de los Diputados, 2006.\nThis column tracks which deaths listed there appear in which lines in our dataset.

    "text": "The database treats events as a fundamental unit. Event is a term with many definitions in the study of social movements and contentious politics from the pivotal historical moment to the action at a single time and place as recorded by news media, but the meaning used in the database is perhaps best captured by Charles Tilly’s term episodes: “bounded sequences of continuous interaction.” Bolivian mass mobilisation is organized in a routine sequence — collective organisation, mass mobilisation, escalation of tactics, negotiation, and concessions — and organizers work to propel the process forward repeatedly until the target, usually the government, gives in. Repressive force seeks to interrupt this process, usually by punishing movements in the mobilisation or escalation stages. For purposes of the database, we treat a relatively continuous series of actions as a single episode or event, unless and until it is interrupted by demobilisation.\n\n\n\nevent_title: Provides location and general theme of event\n\nEvent titles are brief, unique textual identifiers that should readily bring to mind the event (especially if the reader has heard of it before), and inform us as to what makes it distinctive. Therefore, unlike other elements of this codebook, there is rarely a single right answer. Also, we should be working to make these titles distinct, so when there are a lot of parallel events, we will need to be more specific.\nUse well-known names for events, if possible.\nThe event_title should state the scope of the conflict; name a locality or workplace if the conflict (or the notable deadly violence) is local. If the conflict is widespread, it should more often name the movement involved. It should name the social movement sector involved if relevant.\nIt should not name the form of violence unless it is unusual.\nUnique means that each event_title is distinct from all others in the dataset. Where needed add the year at the end of the event_title, then month or month pair. For example “Gas War 2003”, “CSUTCB mobilization April 2000.”\nThe variables, and this document are segmented into sections, each of which comprise several variables.",

Likewise the multiple names for someone who has not been positively identified: Juan Carlos / Corado / Corado / NN | Ventura / Vilca / Veizaga / Fernández / Bejarano.\nWhen we have explicit reporting that a name was wrong, put the correct name in the name field and describe the misidentification in Complications: Gustavo | Cartagena Trujillo | Victim initially misidentified as “Edgar Vidal Rocha.”\n\n\n\n\nid_indiv — A unique identifier for each individual in the dataset that allows for cross referencing as the dataset evolves.\n\nWe want to be able to track changes in knowledge about individuals, for all fields including their names, so we assign each individual a unique identifier. This means that if their name changes, we change their inclusion status in the database (because, for example, we determine their death was accidental, or were misreported as dead), regroup them with different events, or determine that they are in fact a duplicate of another person, we can link that individual across different versions of the dataset.\nUnique IDs will also be assigned to individuals in the “Excluded from current analysis” tab once that tab is refactored to include all existing variables.\nIndividual ID (id_indiv) will take the form of the lowercase letter i followed by five numerical digits.\n\ni — is for individual (a conveniently bilingual first letter)\nFirst two digits assigned by year and allowing the research team to keep the unique ID’s roughly chronological without generating confusion among uninformed researchers.\n\n01 Indicates an unknown year\n02 corresponds to 1982;\n10 corresponds to 1990; 20 to 2000; 30 to 2010; 40 to 2020. So, deaths in 2019 would typically begin i39\n\nLast three digits are assigned sequentially in rough chronological order, beginnig with 001.\n\nWhere multiple events are occurring simultaneously, we will try to number sequentially within the events first.\n\nEvery line in the dataset gets an individual ID, including unconfirmed = TRUE, intentionality = Nonconflict accident, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\ndec_age: reported age\ndec_alt_age: alternatively reported ages\n\nExpressed as an integer. Unless under two years, then we may also have a fraction in twelths.\nData entry for months: Type: &lt;equals&gt; &lt;number of months&gt; &lt;division slash&gt; 12. So, six months: “=6/12.”\n\ndec_gender: gender\n\nOptions: M, F, text explanation\n\ndec_ethnicity: ethnicity\n\nOptions: Mestizo/Creole, Afro-Bolivian, or indigenous group name like Quechua, Aymara, Yuracaré.\n\nFor indigenous groups, use names as listed first in the following table. Use accents. Hyphenate if a mix of the above, and join alphabetically: Aymara-Guaraní.\nFor immigrant ethnicities use Adjective-Bolivian: Palestinian-Bolivian.\nForeign ethnicities of non-citizens: Adjective. Multiples: Adjective/Adjective.\n\nIf there are two or more ethnicities coinciding: hyphens (or slashes for foreigners)\nIf we are not sure which of two ethnicities we use “or”\nIf any uncertainty, leave blank until more information is found.\n\n\nImage of contemporary groups provided by Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndec_residence: Indicates place of residence, not origin\n\nProvide the most specific location as is know. For example, if community is known, provide community. If it is not known “Municipality” is fine; “Municipality, Department” where ambiguous. “Department” where that’s all we know.\nIf there’s a longer story (e.g., a Huanuni miner of El Alto origin), list their current long-term residence (Huanuni, Oruro) in this field and add to the notes.\n\ndec_nationality: nationality\n\nProper noun of the country in English, not an adjective: Bolivia, Peru, United States, etc. Reported dual nationals get slashes: France/Bolivia.",

For example- if a person died in a fire the cause of death would be the building burning. The Medical cause of death would be burns.\n\nIf coinciding factors resulted in a death, a comma is used to symbolize plurality. Ex. (gunshot, impact)= (gunshot and impact).\nIf reports consistently note two different causes of death and the exact cause is not known a slash is used to denote OR. Ex. (gunshot/beating)= (gunshot or beating).\nBlank spaces indicate that cause of death is unknown.\nCauses of death include the following. This list is not exhaustive; other categories not listed below, but included in the database are self-explanatory.\n\nInduced health crisis: (induced via social circumstances including extra stress due to protest conditions or previous accident or injury sustained in a political event)\nIllness: An illness that occured during but not as a result of political events\nLack of necessary care: (lack of needed care due to difficulty reaching care and/or external forces preventing care. If the person was injured and then prevented from reaching necessary care, the injury is listed first in cause of death and more specific circumstances are detailed in the notes).\nGunshot: Fatal wound incurred from a gun (live ammunition)\nImpact: hit with an object thrown or projected at them during protest (rocks, stones, tear gas canister). Not from a gun or interpersonal beating.\nAssault: signifies an attack that can include both a beating and weapons such as knifes and machetes\nBeating: No weapons were used, violent interpersonal force\nVehicle: Incident involving a vehicle. Specifics of death are noted in parentheses, ie: hit by car (which implies that the individual was not in a car when struck; car crash (the individual was in a car when struck); dragged (individual was not in a car when dragging occurred).\nExplosion: Any explosion caused by a variety of weapons, (IED, gas station, grenade, dynamite, etc.)\nNon-conflict: Indicates that the death occurred outside of a conflict or political situation\n[Blank]: Left blank if precise cause of death is unknown\n\n\n\n\n\ncause_medical: brief, nominal description of the medical cause of the death\n\nA succinct medical description of why the person died; what hospitals report or what appears in an autopsy. Generally a noun phrase laden with jargon.\nGiven the technical language, it’s generally good to keep untranslated language here, unless we are really confident of the wording.\n\n\n\n‘munition’ assesses whether live ammunition and other dangerous explosives were used in the killing. The order below indicates both relative danger and a prioritization for coding. (That is, if someone was both shot with live ammunition and teargassed, we code “Live ammunition” (1) instead of “Tear gas” (3).)\nFormerly live_ammunition; Alluvial2.Rmd has code to deal with both cases.\n\nmunition: (note that explosive is a new category)\n\nDenotes if live ammunition was used and other categories of ammunition.\n\nLive ammunition: live ammunition / standard gunshot. “Bala,” “balazo,” “proyectil arma de fuego,” “raffaga” in sources all count as yes. So do descriptions involving named types of guns.\nExplosive: Indicates an explosive not fired as a projectile: grenades, dynamite, homemade explosive device (“explosivo casero,” “cazabobos”), bomb vest.\nLess lethal munition: non-“live ammunition” projectile. Non-lethal/less-lethal munitions (tear gas canister, rubber or wooden bullets). “Perdigón” (marble/shot), “balín” (rubber bullet/plastic bullet/shot) in description.\nTear gas: Tear gas (not the canister)\nOther violence: (was “N/A”) No munitions of any kind are involved but physical violence still took place. Ex. Torture, beating, vehicle, stabbing, arson. As such, this category still indicates some form of interpersonal interaction/violence.\nNone: No weapon at all was used. Death was the result of illness or fall, drowning, electrocution, etc.\n[Blank] — We don’t know what weapon was used.\nLikely [category name] as described for quasilogicals\nTwo potential possibilties are linked with or\n\n\n\n\n\nvictim_armed: Quasilogical on whether the decedent was armed\n\n\nYes only if carrying a gun. “Presumed Yes,” if member of a security force, but we lack specific information. No if non-lethal/less-lethal munitions.\nDisarmed — an additional value that indicates that the subject carried a lethal weapon, but was disarmed of it prior to being killed.\nWith Explosive — If the victim carried an explosive not fired as a projectile: grenades, dynamite, homemade explosive device (“explosivo casero,” “cazabobos”), bomb vest.\nPresumed Yes — We presume that state security force members are armed. (Though obviously we don’t ignore evidence to the contrary.)\nWe presume that when sources describe a group the victim was part of as armed, but do not specifically note that the victim was armed, the victim was armed.\nPresumed No — We presume uninvolved bystanders, children, and those engaged in explicitly non-confrontational protest (e.g., hunger strikers) are unarmed.\nLikely Yes, Likely No, Disputed, blank as described for quasilogicals\n\n\nweapon: What weapon was used? Nominal factor. Weapon listed when in need of clarification. If the death could have been caused by more than one option, a slash is used to indicate alternatives. Options, in priority order:\n\n\nBullet — Always the term for gunfire with live ammunition. We’re completely un-interested in descriptions of the firing weapons. No “rifles,” “pistols” etc.\nLess-lethal munition —If specific munition is not known “less lethal munition” is used. If specific munition is known it is listed.\nNon-lethal/less-lethal munitions options include: (rubber or wooden bullets). “Perdigón” (marble/shot), “balín” (rubber bullet/plastic bullet/shot) in description. Also includes bladed weapons such as knifes and machetes. But not tear gas or teargas canisters, which get their own categories.\n\n\nTear-gas canister — for effects of its physical impact\nTear gas (no hyphen) — for effects of inhalation\nExplosive- cazabobos, grenade etc.\nProjectile — things that are thrown, hurled, or slingshotted. Specific weapon listed in parentheses\n\n\nArson- Purposefully induced fire\nTorture- Denotes that torture is specifically noted in the reports of the death. No researcher judgment was made in the term.\nStrangulation- Some weapon was used to strangle the victim\nBeating — no weapons, but violent interpersonal force\nNon-conflict accident- Death was caused outside of a conflict incident\nFall- Denotes that the victim fell from some surface(often while fleeing conflict repression). From where the victim fell is indicated in ().\nVehicle: Some type of vehicle accident was involved. The type of incident is indicated in ().\nGas station explosion\nStones/rocks\nNone: No weapon was involved. Includes drowning, some falls etc.\nBlank: The specific weapon used is unknown\n\nPriority order means that if something matches two of the options listed here, we report the first one. So yes, a tear-gas canister is a projectile, but we don’t have to say both.",

This includes cases where the weapon (e.g. a teargas canister or tear gas itself) is usually nonlethal. We can assess such cases by looking at the weapons involved. This also includes victims of beatings, assaults, deaths from physical confrontations (unless the victim is a bystander). This also includes instances of mistaken identification.\nBystander: A deliberate attack that killed someone outside of the conflict (e.g. Victor Hugo Daza in 2000)\nRe: journalists, mediators, etc.: Let’s flag these as “Direct on journalist/mediator/etc” and try to see if there’s something to figure out. From what I can tell, there are several instances of deliberately targeted journalists (Encinas, the Alta Loma journalist guide, Radio Municipal death, etc.). I’m not sure there is a clear instance of a bystander.\nConflict Accident: Any unintended death that occurs through no deliberate attempt to harm, but which was perpetrated by someone engaging in the conflict. e.g., weapons misfires, dynamite that explodes in the hand of a protester). Includes “Friendly fire”: Any unintended death that was caused through acts of violence, but which was perpetrated by someone engaging in the conflict and which strikes someone with whom they are acting together.\n\nRegardless of whether a weapon was involved… 5. Self-sacrifice: includes starvation in hunger strike, suicide (related to conflict incident), or intentionally self-inflicted death with a weapon . Explicitly excludes accidental self-inflicted death with a weapon (those are conflict accidents).\nWhen no weapon is involved… 6. Conflict Accident: Any unintended death that occurs through no deliberate attempt to harm, but which was perpetrated by someone engaging in the conflict. e.g., protesters pull down a wall, but kill someone in the process; electrocution in the process of scaling a secured facility) 7. Non-conflict Accident: Any unintended death that occurs through no deliberate attempt to harm, and outside the context of open physical confrontation: e.g., car crash into a protest march (which the driver was not targeting) 8. Non-conflict: Any other death whose causes can’t be traced to acts of conflict, but for which the word “accidental” is inappropriate. Includes situations where a medical situation leads to death, but is not traceable to the privations of conflict. And situations where interpersonal violence is not related to political conflict (e.g., armed robbery), and cases of non-conflict-driven suicides. 9. Incidental: Any indirect consequence of intended acts upon the participants. Deaths from the privations of nationwide marches, or due to the follow-on trauma of police raid. (or if someone had died in Chaparina when the police blockaded the marchers and denied access to food). Includes deaths to children of participants collateral to their acts. 10. Collateral: Any indirect consequence of intended acts upon non-participants. Deaths from lack of medical attention due to blockades, consequences of re-routed plane flights, etc.\n&gt;&gt; Possibility of unknown or disputed causality, as in the case of Campanas during the Water War. Weapon is “hanging”; Intentionality is disputed between direct/self-sacrifice.",

Where municipal boundaries have changed, we use specific locality to specify the current, smaller municipality. But if no information is available on a smaller scale than the municipality name, we use the named municipality.

Includes recorded statements, confessions, and guilty pleas.

If we are indicating “disputed,” that means not only is the answer disputed, but also that we cannot resolve the dispute. On the other hand, we have a variable for “denial” in the database that will absorb explanations by interested parties that are judged implausible. There are many cases when officials (and occasionally other responsible parties) make claims that deny their responsibility and put it on the victims. Those will be recorded as full or partial denials in the denial variable, and explained in the denied_by variable.

For example, the Laymi-Qaqachaka confrontations. - Partisan Politics - Mining - Economic Policies - Labor - Peasant - Municipal governance: Disputes or conflicts over elected officials in the municipal government. - Urban land: Conflicts over territorial borders or land ownership in urban areas. For example, the Pampa San Miguel urban land conflict. - Drug Trade - Guerilla - Ethno-Ecological: Mobilizations over the protection of the environment and/or protection or authority over cultural connections to land and environmental resources. For example, the TIPNIS mobilizations. - Local Development - Disabled: Mobilizations surrounding the rights of those with disabilities - Paramilitary - Contraband - Education\n\n\n\n\npol_assassination: Quasilogical. We define “political assassinations” as targeted killings of persons in organizational leadership or political office. Includes cases where the killing is carried out amid a larger scenario but in a highly targeted fashion.\n\n\nYes\nNo\nLikely Yes – as described for quasilogicals\nPossibly Yes — Indicates that evidence (typically evidence that the murder was politically motivated) is limited, but the act could be assassination.\n\n\n\n\n\nstate_perpetrator: Were state security forces the perpetrator Quasilogical. Addresses the narrow question of whether state security forces carried out the killing.\n\n\nYes\nNo\nLikely Yes, Likely No – as described for quasilogicals\nDisputed – as described for quasilogicals, opposing narratives and we can’t decide\n\nReminder: Presumed categories refer to conclusions we draw for reasons listed here in the codebook\n\nPresumed Yes — When a short textual source uses the passive voice (“resultó muerto”) regarding the death of a non-state actor in a security forces vs. movement confrontation..\nPresumed No — Deaths of non-state actors described as due to nearly exclusively non-state weapons such as rocks or dynamite\nIndirect — When a State security force did not directly inflict harm through physical violence but actively contributed to the death through their actions (involvement in repression). For example, if a victim was fleeing state repression and fell or were trampled etc.\n\n\nstate_responsibility: Categorical characterization of state responsibility\n\nThis categorical characterization does not take qualifiers like “likely”, “presumed”, etc. They can be found in state_perpetrator and in intentionality.\n\n\n\nTally of state responsibility values on December 6, 2022\n\n\nIn analyzing the data, we’ve found it necessary to add more categories related to security forces in mutiny, so as to sort out state responsibility from non-state-coordinated action by security forces.\n\nState perpetrator: A state actor is responsible for the action that caused the victim’s death. Assertive programming should verify that this coincides with one of the “Yes” categories for state_perpetrator.\nState victim\nSeparate from state: Mobilization and conflict does not involve State actors or mobilizations against governmental policies\nState involved: Though a State actor did not commit the act responsible for the victim’s death, the State was involved in crafting the conditions in which the conflict emerged.\nPolitical Victim: The victim held an elected position in government\n\n\nstate_failure: Brief explanation of state failures that contributed to deaths. Variable consists of a textual explanation.\n\nUnnecessary when state responsibility takes the form of State perpetrator, but occasionally a valuable addition. For example, if some state oversight create a situation where state violence was more likely.\n\nUnpoliced situation — Indicates that deadly violence among non-state actors was predictable, but the State took no meaningful action.\nTry to summarize multiple failures as in ““Dept govt employees among perpetrators, armed state allies present, policing failures”",

This “catastrophic stalemate” was a deadlock between a broad coalition of the rural and urban indigenous peoples, movements of the poor and working class (collectively, the “left grassroots”) and the Morales’ Movement Toward Socialism (MAS-IPSP) party on one side, and a political opposition backed by right-wing “civic movements” calling for regional autonomy from that government. While the heart of the right’s resistance to the Morales government was the eastern departments (Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, and Tarija), major episodes occurred in the central cities of Cochabamba and Sucre. In Santa Cruz, Cochabamba, and Beni, (and possibly Pando and Tarija) there’s a departmental Civic Committee at the heart of the civic movement.

    "text": "The Ultimate Consequences database enumerates individual deaths in Bolivian political conflict since October 1982, the end of military rule in the country. It is compiled by the research team based on multiple sources, including media reports, governmental, intergovernmental, and private human rights reports, and use of the research literature on political conflict. The dataset now includes nearly all of the deaths identified by a Permanent Assembly of Human Rights-Bolivia (APDHB) study of deaths from 1988 to 2003, and a study of the coca conflict from 1982 to 2005 (Navarro Miranda 2006; Llorenti 2009; Salazar Ortuño 2008). Unlike prior compilations by human rights organizations, however, this database includes a variety of qualitative variables designed to understand how and why the deaths occurred and what policies and patterns underpin them.\nThe scale of the dataset for this period is both large enough to identify significant patterns and small enough (unlike the situation in some other Latin American countries) to permit the construction of a database that includes detailed information about every death. Precisely because its coverage is nearly comprehensive, the database offers a systematic sample of cases for quantitative and/or qualitative analysis, untainted by selection bias.\n\n\nThis project follows in traditions of datasets designed to analyze the frequency of political conflict, and to bring accountability for acts of violence. Many conflict-related datasets were constructed using passive forms of monitoring, such as the World Labor Group database (Silver 2003, 181–97), which enumerated all labor strikes recorded by two major newspapers, and Airwars’ (n.d.) monitoring of news coverage of deaths in air strikes. These projects sought to rapidly capture many known cases with roughly constant likelihood over time. When reports conflict, Airwars grades the quality of reporting and documents the minimum number of deaths reported. Compilations by human rights monitors, by contrast, gather more detailed information on causality and responsibility and are motivated by holding states and armed nonstate actors to account.\nOur project draws on journalistic, advocacy, and scholarly sources to comprehensively document all deaths in political conflict, including those not readily categorizable as human rights violations. Not only does this approach allow more complete coverage of the topic, but it also allows us to shed light on which kinds of deaths are documented or ignored by different sources. We began the project with journalistic compilations of conflict deaths, and human rights reports by domestic and international human rights bodies. Our iterative research strategy then sought out additional information from two Bolivian NGO publications that archive and summarize news about social movement activity, archives of the Bolivian news media, and a range of other sources. The multivariable design of our database, as well as internal rating system for the quality of our descriptions, drives our search for additional sources on each lethal event.\n\n\n\nThe situations described in the dataset principally involve the following: 1. Deaths from repression or confrontations with security forces during protest 2. Deaths from security force incursions into politically active communities that are related to their activism 3. Deaths from inter-movement and intra-movement confrontations 4. Deaths of all kinds related to guerrilla or paramilitary activity 5. Deaths of all kinds related to the conflict over coca growing 6. Political assassinations of all kinds, including public officials, political activists, and journalists 7. Deaths of social movement participants while in police custody for their activism 8. Deaths from the hardships of protests and acts of self-sacrifice such as hunger strikes, long-distance marches etc. 9. Acts of suicide as a form of protest 10. All deaths related to land conflicts that involve a collective/social movement organization on at least one side.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of this analysis, I excluded deaths classified as “collateral”, defined as indirect consequences of intentional but nonviolent acts upon non-participants. (Our codebook refers to “weapons, arson, or assault” rather than “violence.”) I also excluded non-conflict-related accidents (e.g., car crashes outside confrontational scenarios) and health incidents (e.g., heart attacks of marchers) that occurred during conflicts. The database also handles the situation where a report of an uncertain number of deaths (e.g., three to five) was recorded by tagging the excess deaths as “unconfirmed.” For the remainder of this article, I refer to deaths not filtered in any of these ways as “confirmed deaths.”\n\n\n\nEach death record includes identifying information about the person who died, the individual or group who caused the death, the place and time of the death, the cause and circumstances of the death, whether the death appears to be deliberate or intended, the geographic location, the death’s connection to social movements and social movement campaigns, sources of information available about the death, types of investigation that have been performed, accountability processes, and relationship to the Bolivian state. Analytical variables used so far include: political assassination (a binary yes/no category); protest domain (aggregating all protest campaigns into a small number of topics such as “labor” and “municipal governance”); and denial (a binary yes/no category indicating whether the perpetrator denied responsibility for the death). In creating database entries, we create brief narrative descriptions of the events involved and/or quote such descriptions directly from sources of reporting. We also are collecting textual segments of reporting and testimonial narrative relevant to each death.\n\n\n\nThe analysis in this article uses events rather than individual deaths as its cases. Every death is associated with precisely one event, and each event is coded as part of a “protest domain,” one of 18 general areas of political contention, and a more specific “protest campaign.” ‘Event’ is a term with many definitions in the study of social movements and contentious politics from the pivotal historical moment to the action at a single time and place as recorded by news media, but the meaning used in the database is perhaps best captured by Charles Tilly’s term episodes: ‘bounded sequences of continuous interaction’.\nBolivian mass mobilisation is organized in a routine sequence— collective organisation, mass mobilisation, escalation of tactics, negotiation, and concessions—and organizers work to propel the process forward repeatedly until the target, usually the government, gives in. Repressive force seeks to interrupt this process, usually by punishing movements in the mobilisation or escalation stages. For purposes of the database, we treat a relatively continuous series of actions as a single episode or event, unless and until it is interrupted by demobilisation. (In a handful of instances where the nature of political violence dramatically shifts, a single mobilisation is divided into separate events\nData for events is entered in a separate page of the Google Sheets database called “Event Status” and archived in the R whenever it’s used. For each of the events with three or more deaths, the PI surveyed news reports and academic writings on the conflicts involved and described the results of the protest event from the point of view of the protesting group. In our event table, these outcomes are coloured as a binary movement success (green) or repression success (red), while the text describes the outcome. Several were coded as successes but we note a ‘(Partial) agreement’ by the government. One case, the 1988 Villa Tunari massacre, was coded as having a mixed outcome. Future coding efforts will address those events with one or two deaths.\n\n\n\nThe research using the database takes place in two steps: drawing on documentary and other sources to name and code the circumstances of each of the deaths, and analyzing patterns in loss and political violence based on information in the database. The task of providing transparency and reproducibility differs between these two steps. Regarding the first step, we have compiled bibliographic information about sources, quotes from those sources, and comments about any complications in coding into the database and a narrative summary of “complex cases” in the dataset. Coding decisions are made according to a codebook, which we also share. Criteria for including or excluding deaths from database are also listed in the codebook, and deaths that we have chosen to exclude (for example, due to inaccurate reports and non-conflict accidents) are archived within the database. Each entry in our database currently lists sources consulted, and we are compiling fully-cited narrative descriptions for each lethal event. We will make this sourcing transparent through by posting these cited narratives, maintaining a public Zotero library of referenced sources, and making scanned documents available to other researchers. Coupling our dataset with its sources allows historical and social scientific researchers to validate our conclusions and build their own scholarship on the source materials we provide.\nWhen we analyze the dataset, we will ground our choices in clearly defined criteria, using categorical information in the database wherever possible. By specifying our search criteria for relevant cases, explaining exceptions, and embedding our analysis techniques in R scripts that use the database, we document our choices and create tools that can automatically update results when additional cases are uncovered, errors are corrected, or new information is brought to light. Archiving and versioning (Klump et al. 2020) of the database and these tools allows other researchers to both reproduce our results, and test their robustness against different choices in coding or analysis.",

Analytical variables used so far include: political assassination (a binary yes/no category); protest domain (aggregating all protest campaigns into a small number of topics such as “labor” and “municipal governance”); and denial (a binary yes/no category indicating whether the perpetrator denied responsibility for the death). In creating database entries, we create brief narrative descriptions of the events involved and/or quote such descriptions directly from sources of reporting. We also are collecting textual segments of reporting and testimonial narrative relevant to each death.",

    "text": "The analysis in this article uses events rather than individual deaths as its cases. Every death is associated with precisely one event, and each event is coded as part of a “protest domain,” one of 18 general areas of political contention, and a more specific “protest campaign.” ‘Event’ is a term with many definitions in the study of social movements and contentious politics from the pivotal historical moment to the action at a single time and place as recorded by news media, but the meaning used in the database is perhaps best captured by Charles Tilly’s term episodes: ‘bounded sequences of continuous interaction’.\nBolivian mass mobilisation is organized in a routine sequence— collective organisation, mass mobilisation, escalation of tactics, negotiation, and concessions—and organizers work to propel the process forward repeatedly until the target, usually the government, gives in. Repressive force seeks to interrupt this process, usually by punishing movements in the mobilisation or escalation stages. For purposes of the database, we treat a relatively continuous series of actions as a single episode or event, unless and until it is interrupted by demobilisation. (In a handful of instances where the nature of political violence dramatically shifts, a single mobilisation is divided into separate events\nData for events is entered in a separate page of the Google Sheets database called “Event Status” and archived in the R whenever it’s used. For each of the events with three or more deaths, the PI surveyed news reports and academic writings on the conflicts involved and described the results of the protest event from the point of view of the protesting group. In our event table, these outcomes are coloured as a binary movement success (green) or repression success (red), while the text describes the outcome. Several were coded as successes but we note a ‘(Partial) agreement’ by the government. One case, the 1988 Villa Tunari massacre, was coded as having a mixed outcome. Future coding efforts will address those events with one or two deaths.",

    "text": "The research using the database takes place in two steps: drawing on documentary and other sources to name and code the circumstances of each of the deaths, and analyzing patterns in loss and political violence based on information in the database. The task of providing transparency and reproducibility differs between these two steps. Regarding the first step, we have compiled bibliographic information about sources, quotes from those sources, and comments about any complications in coding into the database and a narrative summary of “complex cases” in the dataset. Coding decisions are made according to a codebook, which we also share. Criteria for including or excluding deaths from database are also listed in the codebook, and deaths that we have chosen to exclude (for example, due to inaccurate reports and non-conflict accidents) are archived within the database. Each entry in our database currently lists sources consulted, and we are compiling fully-cited narrative descriptions for each lethal event. We will make this sourcing transparent through by posting these cited narratives, maintaining a public Zotero library of referenced sources, and making scanned documents available to other researchers. Coupling our dataset with its sources allows historical and social scientific researchers to validate our conclusions and build their own scholarship on the source materials we provide.\nWhen we analyze the dataset, we will ground our choices in clearly defined criteria, using categorical information in the database wherever possible. By specifying our search criteria for relevant cases, explaining exceptions, and embedding our analysis techniques in R scripts that use the database, we document our choices and create tools that can automatically update results when additional cases are uncovered, errors are corrected, or new information is brought to light. Archiving and versioning (Klump et al. 2020) of the database and these tools allows other researchers to both reproduce our results, and test their robustness against different choices in coding or analysis.",

    "text": "Re-coding 2019 data\nHere we manually recode the 2019 deaths into events several ways. As the article explains:\n\nThe complex series of events poses delicate questions about lumping or splitting deaths. I opted to characterize the anti-Morales protest wave (which coincided with counterprotests in support of the president) as one event up to his November 10 resignation (in Quadrant 4). … The violence that followed Morales’ pressured resignation (on November 10–13) in various locations forms a second event (in Quadrant 2)… I also chose to treat the Sacaba and Senkata massacres of November 15 and 19 as two further events of one-sided state repression (Quadrant 1). An alternate approach would have clustered all of the violence after Morales’ resignation into a single event (in Quadrant 2) in which security forces caused at least 26, and as many as 29 deaths, while suffering the loss of two of their number. In the supplementary materials, I include a robustness analysis that how these categorisation choices have only small effects on the overall outcomes of the study.\n\nThis block of code groups events during the crisis. In all versions of the analysis, events before Evo Morales’ resignation are merged. If merge_regional_post_resignation is set TRUE, post-resignation events grouped by place. If merge_all_post_resignation is set TRUE, all post-resignation events are grouped into a single event.\n\n\nCode in R\n## First gather all pre-resignation deaths into one event\ncluster.2019.explanation &lt;- paste(\"**2019 Event Handling:**\")\n\n\nde &lt;- de %&gt;% mutate(event_title = case_when(\n                       event_title==\"La Paz pro-Evo election march\" ~ \"Pre-resignation protests\",\n                       event_title==\"Montero election clashes\" ~ \"Pre-resignation protests\",\n                       event_title==\"Metro Cochabamba election clashes\" ~ \"Pre-resignation protests\",\n                       event_title==\"La Paz journalist beaten to death\" ~ \"Pre-resignation protests\",\n                                       TRUE ~ event_title\n        ))   \ncluster.2019.explanation &lt;- paste(cluster.2019.explanation, \n                  \"Pre-resignation events merged.\", sep=\" \")\n\n## Next gather all early post-resignation deaths (November 10-13) into one a second event event\nmerge_regional_post_resignation &lt;- FALSE # flag; change to TRUE for robustness check\nmerge_all_post_resignation &lt;- FALSE # flag; change to TRUE for robustness check\n\nif(merge_regional_post_resignation){\n   de &lt;- de %&gt;% mutate(event_title = case_when(\n                      event_title==\"La Paz post-resignation violence\" \n                                          ~ \"Metro La Paz post-resignation (combined)\",\n                      event_title==\"Senkata Massacre\" ~ \"Metro La Paz post-resignation (combined)\",\n                      event_title==\"Metro Cochabamba post-resignation violence\" ~ \"Metro Cochabamba post-resignation (combined)\",\n                      event_title==\"Sacaba massacre\" ~ \"Metro Cochabamba post-resignation (combined)\",\n                      event_title==\"Sacaba Massacre\" ~ \"Metro Cochabamba post-resignation (combined)\",                      \n                      TRUE ~ event_title\n      ))\n   cluster.2019.explanation &lt;- paste(cluster.2019.explanation, \"Post-resignation events grouped by place.\", sep=\" \")\n}else{\n   de &lt;- de %&gt;% mutate(event_title = case_when(\n                       event_title==\"La Paz post-resignation violence\" ~ \"Post-resignation protests\",\n                       event_title==\"Metro Cochabamba post-resignation violence\" ~ \"Post-resignation protests\",\n                       event_title==\"Betanzos post-resignation violence\" ~ \"Post-resignation protests\",\n                       event_title==\"Montero post-resignation clash\" ~ \"Post-resignation protests\",\n                       event_title==\"Yapacaní post-resignation clash\" ~ \"Post-resignation protests\",\n                       TRUE ~ event_title\n   ))\n   if(!merge_all_post_resignation){\n     cluster.2019.explanation &lt;- paste(cluster.2019.explanation, \n                  \"Early post-resignation events (November 10-13) merged.\", sep=\" \")  \n   }\n}\n\nif(merge_all_post_resignation)\n{\n  de &lt;- de %&gt;% mutate(event_title = case_when(\n                      event_title==\"Post-resignation protests\" ~ \"Post-resignation protests (inclusive)\",\n                      event_title==\"Sacaba massacre\" ~ \"Post-resignation protests (inclusive)\",\n                      event_title==\"Sacaba Massacre\" ~ \"Post-resignation protests (inclusive)\",\n                      event_title==\"Senkata Massacre\" ~ \"Post-resignation protests (inclusive)\",\n                      event_title==\"Metro Cochabamba post-resignation (combined)\" ~ \"Post-resignation protests (inclusive)\",\n                      event_title==\"Metro La Paz post-resignation (combined)\" ~ \"Post-resignation protests (inclusive)\",\n                      TRUE ~ event_title\n        ))\n  cluster.2019.explanation &lt;- paste(cluster.2019.explanation, \"All post-resignation events merged.\", sep=\" \")\n}",

Here we use:\n\nevent_title — The name of the event, which should be a unique identifier\nprotest_campaign — the larger protest campaign it was a part of\nyear — the year the death occurred in.\n\nAs event_title uniquely identifies an event, summarizing by it alone should be enough, but including all three lets us check for accidentally naming two different events by the same name.\nWe can combine group_by and summarize to generate a variety of counts for each event. Here are the counts we create.\nSome are generated from the filtered list of deaths, deaths and put in the table campaign.events\n\nn — Number of (filtered) deaths\nn_state_perp — Number of deaths perpetrated by state security forces.\nn_state_victim — Number of deaths with a state victim, not counting accidental or incidental deaths.\nn_state_separate — Number of deaths happening separate from state involvement\n\nOthers are generated from the unfiltered list of deaths, deaths_unfiltered and put in the table campaign.events_unfiltered\n\nn_unconfirmed— Number of unconfirmed deaths (whethe total number reported is a range)\nn_collateral — Number of collateral deaths (caused indirectly by nonviolent actions)\nn_nonconflict — Number of nonconflict deaths\nn_state_perp_hi — A higher estimate of the number of deaths perpetrated by state security forces, including otherwise filtered out plus cases where the state’s responsibility is disputed.\nn_state_victim_hi — A higher estimate of the number of deaths with a state victim, including deaths otherwise filtered out.\nn_state_separate_hi — A higher estimate of the number of deaths separate from the state, including deaths otherwise filtered out.\nn_unfiltered— the grand total of all deaths associated with the event in the database\n\nNext we merge these two events tables using join functions. We will use “key” columns in campaign.events to make this join, but this means we leave out events that only appear in campaign.events_unfiltered. As a check, we perform an “anti_join” and save the ignored events into campaign.events_disqualified. Inspecting that list, we see no events with three or more deaths, so we can move on.\nThe joined table is called campaign.events_joined.\nWe’re only interested in the _hi variables where they differ from the established value, so we use a mutate command to blank the values when they are the same.\nNext we import information from the database about the outcomes of each events (stored in a second sheet of the Google Sheet). We use this information, stored in event.status.relevant to specify the outcomes of each event. We also add information on the domain of protest and current presidential administration from the deaths table itself. (Anomalous events which occur across multiple presidencies have to be dealt with in the code here.)\nFinally, we create campaign.events_joined3 which only includes events with three or more deaths.

(Our codebook refers to “weapons, arson, or assault” rather than “violence.”) I also excluded non-conflict-related accidents (e.g., car crashes outside confrontational scenarios) and health incidents (e.g., heart attacks of marchers) that occurred during conflicts. The database also handles the situation where an uncertain number of deaths (e.g., three to five) was recorded by tagging the excess deaths as “unconfirmed.” For the remainder of this article, I refer to deaths not filtered in any of these ways as “confirmed deaths.”\nThere were 182 events in the dataset before these filters, and 172 after excluding them.

First, larger events may be more likely to precipitate backfire. During the study period in Bolivia, the term “massacre” is only commonly applied to events with at least three deaths. Second, by narrowing our research focus to these larger events, I reduce the sample size to a manageable 48 events, enabling research on the campaigns involved and their outcomes. These larger events account for 422 deaths, 74% of the total. Large events predominate across time, and comprise at least 52.593% of the deaths under all presidents (except Luis Arce, who had just 4 deaths altogether, and Eduardo Rodríguez who had none at all).\nThe tables and graphs that follow break down deaths included and excluded from this study across time and presidency.

This article’s comprehensive examination of significant protest confrontations (as marked by three or more deaths) in Bolivia since 1982 shows that this effort is usually unsuccessful. I surveyed 48 events in recent Bolivian history to find instances when deadly repression backfired against its perpetrators, ending in success for social movements rather than quelling their mobilizations. Out of 28 cases of deadly state repression (Quadrants 1 and 2), movements succeeded in 13 cases (and partially succeded in another), and failed in 10. The cases of movement success (equivalently of repression’s backfire) involved 169 deaths, compared with 77 deaths in cases where repression prevailed. Altogether, security forces killed 136 people in failed bids to quash protests.",

    "text": "Bookdown to Quarto\nConverting a Bookdown book to Quarto is slightly more involved than converting a website. A book has chapters whose order must be defined, and likely has citations and cross-refs. Still, conversion is not that hard.\nWe got some practice converting from Bookdown to Quarto by helping Gavin Fay convert his lab’s fantastic onboarding documentation, the Faylab Lab Manual. Here’s the GitHub view before and after.\nOur best first reference material for this was Nick Tierney’s Notes on Changing from Rmarkdown/Bookdown to Quarto. Nick shares some scripts in that post to automate some changes. In our case, the book was small enough that we made all changes manually. Quarto documentation was indispensable.\n\nExperimenting in a low-risk environment\nWe forked a copy of the Faylab Lab manual to the Openscapes organization, and worked in a branch so we could make changes relatively risk-free. We could always fork a new copy of the original if we “broke” something. (Caution: the default when making a pull request from a fork is to push changes to the original upstream repo, not your fork and it does this without warning if you have write-access to that repo.) With local previews it’s easy to test / play with settings to see what they do. We tended to make a change, Preview, then compare the look and functionality of the book to the original. It was helpful to comment out some elements of the configuration file _output.yml after their counterparts had been added to the Quarto configuration file _quarto.yml, or to confirm they were no longer needed, before making the drastic move of deleting them.\n\n\nThe conversion\nHere are the main steps to convert the Faylab Lab manual from Bookdown to Quarto.\nCreate new empty file called _quarto.yml and add book metadata there. The screenshots below\nSet project type as book.\nMove metadata out of index.qmd and into _quarto.yml. Title, author, and publication date were in index.qmd with date set using date: \"Last updated:r Sys.Date()\". Now these are in _quarto.yml with date set using date: last-modified. Note that having R code would require you to adjust code chunk options in the Quarto style (#|). This tripped us up a bit; see GitHub Actions.\nMove chapters listing out of _bookdown.yml and into _quarto.yml.\nAdd page footer to _quarto.yml.\nHere’s what ours looked like when we finished the steps above (_quarto.yml).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaylab Lab Manual\n\n\n\n\n\nChange insertion of images from html style to Quarto style. (Note Quarto calls them “figures”, not “images”.) The following snippet will insert the GitHub octocat logo in a page:\n![](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"35px\"}\nChange all filename extensions .Rmd -&gt; .qmd (you could Preview after this change and see that the book looks the same). Note that Quarto works with .Rmd files just as well as it does .qmd, so this change is not urgent. In fact, if you have a lot of R code in your .Rmds (unlike the Faylab Lab Manual), there will be additional tinkering needed to make the code chunks happy.\n\n\nCitations\nThe Faylab Lab Manual cited two papers, presenting us with an opportunity to see how easy it is to add references to a Quarto book. Briefly, in the Visual Editor, Insert &gt; Citation &gt; DOI. Pasting the DOI or its full URL, we can insert the citation. This automatically creates a references.bib file and adds the full citations at the bottom of the chapter page (watch demo). In July 2022, we had to manually add a ## References heading, but this may not be necessary in future Quarto updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert citation via its DOI using RStudio Visual Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing notes\nIf the book’s output is strictly html, there’s no need to specify output-dir in _quarto.yml. The output directory default is _book/, which is what we’d like. If we wanted other types of output like like PDF or EPUB, etc. those single file outputs are also written to the output-dir (Quarto docs).\nIf you currently have a docs/ folder, delete it.\nUpdate .gitignore to ignore _book/. At the same time, we have it ignore caches and a .quarto file:\n/.quarto/\n*_cache/\n_book/\nOnce all is settled, delete _output.yml.\nOnce the Openscapes fork was fully reviewed, we made a pull request from that to the main branch of the book’s repo. Once that was merged, we set up GitHub Actions to render the book. (TODO: instructions for GitHub Actions)\n\n\nGitHub Actions\nThis book was mostly prose and screenshots without any R code. This made the conversion from RMarkdown to Quarto likely more straightforward than if you also needed to adjust code chunk options in the quarto style (#|). Our initial GitHub Action to render the converted Faylab Lab Manual failed because we had a piece of R code - even though the code was commented out! This was resolved when we deleted the line."

    "text": "Distill to quarto\nWe transitioned our events site from distill to quarto in May 2022 (github view before and after). We followed excellent notes and examples from Nick Tierney and Danielle Navarro.\nAfter we had changed all the files, the Build tab in the RStudio IDE still showed “Build website” rather then “Render Website” and “Preview Website”, and would error when we pushed them (because that button was expecting a distill site, not a quarto site). To fix this, we updated the .Rproj file. Clicking on the .Rproj file in the RStudio IDE will open a dialog box where you can click things you want (you can also open these in a text editor or from the GitHub website to see the actual text). To fix this situation with the Build tab: Project Options &gt; Build Tools &gt; Project Build Tools &gt; None.\nLooking at files /posts/_metadata.yml and _quarto.yml helps see where things are defined. For example, to make event post citations appear, we added citation: true to /posts/_metadata.yml and in _quarto.yml under the website key we set site-url: https://openscapes.github.io/events. We deleted footer.html used with distill because footer is now defined in quarto.yml.\n\nPublishing notes\n\nBackground: Our distill site had been set up to output to a docs folder, and had GitHub Settings &gt; Pages set to look there rather gh-pages branch. (Julie note: this was a new-to-me capability when we set up the events distill site in Spring 2021 so I had forgotten that was an option). We’ve inititally kept this same set-up for now with our events page in _quarto.yml: output-dir: docs. However, this is sub-optimal; better to not have to commit and push these files but to instead have a GitHub Action generate them upon a commit. So the following is what we did -\n\nDon’t specify output-dir in _quarto.yml. The output directory default is _site/, which is what we’d like.\nIf you currently have a docs/ folder (like we did as we were experimenting), delete it.\nUpdate .gitignore to ignore _site/. At the same time, we have it ignore caches and a .quarto file:\n/.quarto/\n*_cache/\n_site/\nPush these changes, merge into main.\nOn GitHub.com, in your repo, set up GitHub publishing\nFollow instructions from the explore and setup chapter."

A copy of the database on that date is archived for reproducibility of the analysis as data/deaths-entries-2022-11-16.rds. Access is currently available to researchers on request and will be incorporated into the forthcoming public release of the dataset. The queries, data tables, and code used to create them are published online as Bjork-James 2022 at https://ultimateconsequences.github.io/BSJ-Political-Violence.html.\nThis document is designed to enable transparency and reproducibility of our research results. By specifying our search criteria for relevant cases, explaining exceptions, and embedding our analysis techniques in R scripts that use the database, we document our choices and create tools that can automatically update results when additional cases are uncovered, errors are corrected, or new information is brought to light. Archiving and versioning of the database and these tools allows other researchers to both reproduce our results, and test their robustness against different choices in coding or analysis.\nThis document is divided into two parts.

    "text": "Next, process the variables\nFirst, we want to think through which variables are involved. They are:\n\npres_admin — who was the president?\nprotest_domain — The broad arena of politial conflict. Tells us whether to count something as a coca death, or an armed actor death\nstate_perpetrator — Was this death perpetrated by the state?\n\nThese are standard blocks of code, which currently appear in Database Overview.Rmd, and eventually will find a home in a variable set-up function. What does this code do?\n\npres_admin — While imported as a text variable, we want to treat pres_admin as an ordered factor, since presidencies are arranged in chronological, not alphabetical order. president_levels is a vector that puts them in order. We use mutate to recst the variable pres_admin as a factor with these ordered levels. The summary table produced by tabyl shows them in order.\nprotest_domain — Protest domain is an unordered factor, so it’s okay if we leave it as just a character variable.

So if there were “five to eight people killed,” the last three deaths have TRUE in unconfirmed.\nWe also filter out “Collateral”, “Nonconflict”, and “Nonconflict Accident” cases in Intentionality. These cases are both peripheral to some of the purposes of the database. Significantly for comparisons over the long-term, we think that these kinds of deaths are unevenly distributed over time.\n\n\ndef &lt;- de %&gt;%\n  filter(is.na(unconfirmed) | unconfirmed != TRUE) %&gt;%\n  filter(is.na(intentionality) | intentionality != \"Collateral\") %&gt;%\n  filter(is.na(intentionality) | intentionality != \"Nonconflict Accident\") %&gt;% \n  filter(is.na(intentionality) | intentionality != \"Nonconflict\") \n\nde.confirmed &lt;- def",

    "text": "Welcome\nUltimate Consequences is a quantitative and qualitative database, unique in its depth and completeness of coverage, of all conflict deaths in Bolivia since October 1982, a period of largely elected governments and political dynamism. The database enables comparative analysis across twelve presidential administrations, four episodes where protesters successfully sought the end of a presidential term, and 192 protest events in 17 domains of conflict. As of November 2022, the project had identified 621 to 639 of these deaths, including those of 600 named individuals. The database is maintained as a Google Docs spreadsheet, which can be queried by R scripts, and whose reports can be generated internally or exported for further manual coding.\nDue to the number of lethal events in the study period, the dataset is both large enough for quantitative research that analyzes patterns and small enough for qualitative, journalistic, and historical examination of the individual deaths involved. To serve these multiple purposes, we code information such as individuals’ relation to a specific social movement, protest campaign, cause of death, responsible parties, and location, and writing detailed narrative descriptions about major events.\nThe project draws on journalistic, advocacy, and scholarly sources to comprehensively document all deaths in political conflict, including those not readily categorizable as human rights violations. The project also seeks to ask more intimate, and cultural, questions about the role of risk, violence, sacrifice, and loss in transformative social change. As the database reveals, Bolivian protest can involve intense risk, privation, self-sacrifice, and either enduring or inflicting violence. Bolivian social movement traditions include proclamations of fearlessness and vows to carry on their struggles “until the ultimate consequences,” that is, to persist in collective measures and to refuse to be deterred by deadly state violence.\nWe are hard at work on creating simple tools to allow social scientists, oral historians, and human rights advocates to generate and access summary data and individual entries in the database to answer their own questions. In 2023, we will publicly release a R package that will allow researchers to search, query, and visualize the dataset, and multiple web-accessible views of the database.\nThis website is here to provide access to:\n\nBackground and documentation on the project such as descriptions of the project\nTools for visualizing the dataset on the web\n(In 2023) Documentation on our R package for the project\n(In 2023) Cited narrative descriptions of lethal conflict events\nArchived copies of data pages produced using RMarkdown that with automatically generated statements and visualizations that document claims made our research articles.\n\n\n\nVideo introduction to the project",
