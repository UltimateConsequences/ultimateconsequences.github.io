#
# This script handles archiving each version of the dataset that we import. 
# 
# Known issues: 
# 1. granularity is one archive per day 
# 2. Assumes that the most recent dated version is equal to the current version
#    (as it should be if created by update_versioned_archive())
# 3. Currently there is no metadata stored other than the date in the filename
# 4. We haven't yet created any functional tools to load and verify data from 
#    these RDS files, though read_rds() may be adequate.

# function to add the current date to a filepath before the extension
